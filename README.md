# ExoPlayer HLS Mod

This is a modification of the [Google ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) which enables the selection of muxed tracks in HLS Streams.

See this issue for further details: [HLS - ExoPlayer doesn't detect multiple tracks of same type muxed in TS chunks](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2014)


Keep in mind: While I do use this modification for work and will probably update this for the forseeable future, we are moving to the *correct* HLS way in our backend. **This means, eventually this will be abandoned and might not be updated quickly when new releases come out!**.


## Versions

I keep the modifications in separate branches. You can clone these branches and include them in your projects.
